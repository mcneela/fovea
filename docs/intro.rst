Introduction

Dynamical systems play an important role in many scientific fields, but models of such systems can feature many parameters and variables that are confusing to first time users. Fovea is a python package for assisting researchers in the process of building intuition about dynamical systems implemented in algorithms. The package consists of five files.

1. graphics.py
Fovea graphics provides a set of tools allowing the user to visualize the action of dynamical systems as they evolve over time, or as their parameters change. It adds a new level abstraction to the graphical inheritance structure used by Matplotlib.
